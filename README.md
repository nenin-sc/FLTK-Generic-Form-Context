# FLTK-Generic-Form-Context
Small library to stay behind the FLTK interface.

This is a small library to biuld application context with FLTK interface. 
There is an example how to use it. 
It includes registry for the FLTK forms and registry for the FLTK widgets, which allow access to any necessary components from the any part of application.
It also includes simply messaging system (PostBox), aimed on the simple actions like deactivation some widgets, if it is necessary, ets. 
It requires relatively fresh C++ compiler. 
Library and example can be built using CodeBlocks IDE and MinGW compiler.
It was not tested out of Windows, so potentially some issues may occure.
